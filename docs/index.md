### dynardl
Stata module to dynamically simulate autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models.

### Download 
You can download the most recent version of `dynardl` from the project site [here](https://github.com/andyphilips/dynardl/archive/master.zip). This program is part of a suite that also includes `pssbounds` (Jordan and Philips 2017), a Stata module to display the necessary critical values to conduct the Pesaran, Shin and Smith (2001) bounds test for cointegration.

### Version
Current version: 1.0.4. Note that a previous version of this program was called `dynpss`. `dynardl` provides a more flexible lag specification and adds additional plots.

### Description<a id="description"></a>
`dynardl` is a program to produce dynamic simulations of autoregressive distributed lag models (ARDL) of the sort recommended by Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (2001). See Philips (2018) for a discussion of this approach, and [Jordan and Philips](https://github.com/andyphilips/dynardl/raw/master/files/pss_Stata_2017.pdf) (2017) for an in-depth discussion of this program.

`dynardl` is designed to dynamically simulate the effects of a counterfactual change in one weakly exogenous regressor at a point in time, using stochastic simulation techniques. Since the ARDL procedure can produce models that are complicated to interpret, `dynardl` is designed to ease the burden of substantive interpretations through the creation of predicted (or expected) values of the dependent variable (along with associated confidence intervals), which can be plotted to show how a change in one variable "flows" through the model over time. `dynardl` takes 1000 (or however many simulations a user desires) draws of the set of parameters from a multivariate normal distribution, using the estimated parameters and the variance-covariance matrix from the linear regression. All covariates are set to certain values (typically means), which are used to create predicted Y-hat values plus stochastic uncertainty.
